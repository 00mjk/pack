    "body": "# pack v0.11.0\r\n> This is a **beta** release of the Cloud Native Buildpack local CLI. This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice. Note that pack is intended for local image builds, and thus requires a Docker daemon. The [lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle) should be used directly when building on cloud platforms.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- The [Docker daemon](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your workstation or accessible over the network.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n#### macOS\r\n\r\nIf you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install buildpacks/tap/pack\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\nOn Linux you can use the one of the following methods of installation.\r\n\r\n##### Arch Linux\r\n\r\n- [pack-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pack-cli/)\r\n- [pack-cli-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pack-cli-bin/)\r\n\r\n##### Command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(export GH=buildpacks/pack; export LATEST=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/$GH/releases/latest | grep -o -E \"https://.+?-linux.tgz\" | head -1); echo \"$LATEST\"; curl -sSL \"$LATEST\" | sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin/ --no-same-owner -xzv $(basename $GH))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Others\r\n\r\nOtherwise:\r\n\r\n1. Download the `.tgz` or `.zip` file for your platform\r\n2. Extract the `pack` binary\r\n3. (Optional) Add the directory containing `pack` to `PATH`, or copy `pack` to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build                 Generate app image from source code\r\n  rebase                Rebase app image with latest run image\r\n  inspect-image         Show information about a built image\r\n  set-run-image-mirrors Set mirrors to other repositories for a given run image\r\n  set-default-builder   Set default builder used by other commands\r\n  inspect-builder       Show information about a builder\r\n  suggest-builders      Display list of recommended builders\r\n  trust-builder         Trust builder\r\n  create-builder        Create builder image\r\n  package-buildpack     Package buildpack in OCI format.\r\n  suggest-stacks        Display list of recommended stacks\r\n  version               Show current 'pack' version\r\n  report                Display useful information for reporting an issue\r\n  completion            Outputs completion script location\r\n  help                  Help about any command\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -h, --help         Help for 'pack'\r\n      --no-color     Disable color output\r\n  -q, --quiet        Show less output\r\n      --timestamps   Enable timestamps in output\r\n  -v, --verbose      Show more output\r\n      --version      Show current 'pack' version\r\n\r\nUse \"pack [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Info\r\n\r\nBuilders created with this release of the pack CLI continue to contain [lifecycle v0.7.5](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.7.5) by default.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Performance and security improvements ([learn more](https://medium.com/buildpacks/faster-more-secure-builds-with-pack-0-11-0-4d0c633ca619))\r\n    * Trusted builders (#634, #644)\r\n    * Run `analyze`, `restore`, and `export` via a trusted lifecycle image (#631)\r\n    * Run `creator` from the lifecycle (#595)\r\n* Hide stack mixins for `inspect-builder` behind `--verbose` option (#630)\r\n* Add `.cnb` file support for `package-buildpack` dependencies (#633)\r\n* Support `.cnb` files in `create-builder` (#611)\r\n* Overwrite permissions in zip files for FAT formatted entries (#598)\r\n* Error when `--publish` and `--no-pull` are used in an unsupported fashion (#594)\r\n* Adds experimental flagging (#576)\r\n* Add Google builder to `suggest-builders` (#637)\r\n* Update `suggest-builders` to use Paketo builders instead of Cloud Foundry builders (#559)\r\n* Support windows containers for `create-builder` [experimental] (#571)\r\n* Support buildpacks from buildpack registry for `create-builder` and `build` [experimental] (#540)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n* Propagate verbose logging flag to `analyze` and `build` phases (#636)\r\n* `build ... --publish` now respects default process type (#602)\r\n* Support substitution for config files such as from `envsubst` (#592)\r\n* Remove daemon access from `restore` phase (#589)\r\n* `create-builder` can now handle when both `uri` and `image` buildpacks as provided (#625)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n*  Network mode is now respected for all phases of the lifecycle (#595)\r\n    * This means that publishing (`--publish`) might be impacted if the network mode does not have access to the registry to which the image is being published to. Previously, `analyze` and `export` phases used `host` network mode when publishing and now use the `default` (aka `bridge`) network mode.\r\n    * Related conversations: [Slack](https://buildpacks.slack.com/archives/CJ6B92ZSB/p1586528175087900)\r\n    * Solution:\r\n        * Network mode can be configured via the `--network` flag.\r\n* Builders with lifecycle versions that don't have a published lifecycle image will error (#644)\r\n    * This would only impacts builders that are not trusted.\r\n    * Solutions:\r\n        * Set builder as trusted via `pack trust-builder ...` or pass `--trust-builder` to the `build` command.\r\n        * Update builder to use the latest versions of supported lifecycle versions."
